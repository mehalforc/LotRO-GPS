# LotRO-GPS
Lord of the Rings Online - GPS

This plugin needs the Waypoint plugin: https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info640-Waypoint.html.

The datapoints are from the LotRO Companion app: https://github.com/LotroCompanion/lotro-maps-db.

Beta 0.1 done... (Still in progress)

Translated into de, en, and fr. (Hopefully...)

This lists a few categories to mark one at a time, to see what the closest point, by category, is from where you are. Then uses the "Waypoint" plugin to direct you to the point. A trunkated list of map points are taken from the "LotRO Companion" app.

To Use: Make sure the Waypoint plugin is installed and enabled.

1. Press the GPS icon in the upper right hand corner of the game.

2. Mark a category with the check box.

3. Press the first icon in the window that is on the left

4. Press the second icon next to that to bring up Waypoint to find it.

Note: This finds the closest point on the outside map, as the crow flies. If you are within 15m of the point, it finds the next closest point. Yes, you could be bounced back and forth, if the last point is closer than another. (I am working on a way to remember the last three points visited so you won't backtrack.)
