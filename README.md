# LotRO-GPS
Lord of the Rings Online - GPS

Plugin that needs the Waypoint plugin: http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/download640.
And datapoints from the LotRO Companion app: https://github.com/LotroCompanion/lotro-maps-db.

(Still in progress)

This lists a few categories to mark one at a time, to see what the closest point is form where you are. Then uses the "Waypoint" plugin to direct you to the point. A trunkated list of map points are taken from the LotRO Companion app.
