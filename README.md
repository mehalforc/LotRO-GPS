# LotRO-GPS
Lord of the Rings Online - GPS

This plugin needs the Waypoint plugin: https://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info640-Waypoint.html.

The datapoints are from the LotRO Companion app: https://github.com/LotroCompanion/lotro-maps-db.

Beta 0.1 done... (Still in progress)

Translated into de, en, and fr.

This lists a few categories to mark one at a time, to see what the closest point, by category, is from where you are. Then uses the "Waypoint" plugin to direct you to the point. A trunkated list of map points are taken from the "LotRO Companion" app.
